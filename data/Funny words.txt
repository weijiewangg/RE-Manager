Go sleep. You miss 100% of the naps you don’t take.
When your parents tell you to follow your dreams, go to bed!
Don't give up on your dreams, get some sleep in.
No day can be bad enough that some sleep can't fix it.
Happiness consists of getting enough sleep. Just that, nothing more. — Robert A. Heinlein
I love sleep. My life has the tendency to fall apart when I'm awake, you know? — Ernest Hemingway
